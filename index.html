	<p>Welcome to the site! I'm Fajar Ausri and I am a transportation engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in sustainable transportation systems from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. I currently hold a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN.</p>
	<p>My goal is to help in the development of a robust and sustainable transportation network in Indonesia. I have observed the importance of good transportation for economic prosperity from my time living in Japan, Germany, and the United States. Now, with the looming problem of global warming, greener transportation has never been more vital.</p>
	<p>My current research interests include sustainable transportation, public policy, and big data analytics. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the REACT lab in the University of British Columbia. We are studying active transportation methods and its utility to develop a greener city.<a href="/about"> Read more about my life...</a></p>
