	<p>Hi! I'm Fajar Ausri - a transportation engineer currently pursuing a Master's in sustainable transportation systems at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. I currently hold a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN.</p>
	<p>My passion is in sustainable transportation systems. I have observed the importance of efficient transportation infrastructure for economic prosperity from my time living in Japan, Germany, and the United States. Now, with the looming problem of global warming, planning for greener transportation has never been more vital.</p>
	<p>My research career started when I was an undergraduate student at Purdue University. With Dr Hua Cai's uSMART research team, I analysed ridership data in Chicago's Divvy bike-share system and developed a spatio-temporal model to predict demand with an R-squared of 0.92. I learned how to handle big data, handle GIS data, and how to interpret complex models. I joined Dr Alex Bigazzi's [REACT](http://reactlab.civil.ubc.ca/) lab in September 2019 to study active transportation methods and its utility to develop a greener city.</p>
