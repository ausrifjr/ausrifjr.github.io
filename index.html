	<p>Welcome to the site! I'm Fajar Ausri and I am a transportation engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in sustainable transportation systems from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. I currently hold a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN.</p>
	<p>My goal is to help in the development of a robust and sustainable transportation network in Indonesia. I have observed the importance of good transportation for economic prosperity from my time living in Japan, Germany, and the United States. Now, with the looming problem of global warming, greener transportation has never been more vital.</p>
	<p>My research career started when I was an undergraduate student at Purdue University. With Dr Hua Cai's uSMART research team, I analysed ridership data in Chicago's Divvy bike-share system and developed a spatio-temporal model to predict demand with an R-squared of 0.92. I learned how to handle big data, handle GIS data, and how to interpret complex models. I joined Dr Alex Bigazzi's REACT lab in September 2019 to further develop my analytics skills and study active transportation methods and its utility to develop a greener city.</p>
