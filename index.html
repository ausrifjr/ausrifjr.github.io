	<p><em>Welcome to the site! I'm Fajar Ausri and I am a transportation engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in sustainable transportation systems from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. I currently hold a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN.</p>
	<p>My passion for sustainable transportation systems stems from my goal to help in the development of a robust and sustainable transportation network in Indonesia. I have observed the importance of efficient transportation for economic prosperity from my time living in Japan, Germany, and the United States. Now, with the looming crisis in global warming, greener transportation has never been more vital in planning new transportation systems. Active modes of transports such as bike sharing and e-scooters is an emerging form of green transport that promises to improve GHG emissions, public health, and mobility for people of a wide range of socio-economic statuses.</p>
	<p>My current research interests include sustainable transportation, public policy, and big data analytics. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the REACT lab in the University of British Columbia. We are studying active transportation methods and its utility to develop a greener city.<a href="/about"> Read more about my life...</a></p>
